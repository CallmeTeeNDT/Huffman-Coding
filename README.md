# Huffman-Coding
This archive contains a project completed as part of the "Elements of Information Theory" course, in which our group was assigned a practical topic aimed at deepening our understanding of source encoding methods. Specifically, we were tasked with developing a software program and user interface capable of encoding information sources using Huffman coding. The goal was not only to demonstrate our comprehension of the theoretical framework behind data compression but also to apply it in a context relevant to our native language by encoding Vietnamese text using the algorithm we implemented.

To align our work with the objectives of the assignment, our group established two primary goals to be accomplished by the conclusion of the presentation. The first was to design a functional program that would allow users to define file size parameters as well as specify the probability distribution for each distinct message symbol. This required integrating concepts from probability theory and information entropy into our design logic. The second goal focused on simulating the encoding process by applying our program to Vietnamese sentences, thereby allowing us to observe how character frequency and symbol distribution influence overall compression performance.

The structure of our project began with an overview of Huffman coding principles, including a discussion of its algorithmic design and role in reducing redundancy in information transmission. We then transitioned into the broader context of data compression, examining how efficient encoding schemes contribute to minimizing storage and bandwidth requirements. To bring theory into practice, we chose Python as our programming language due to its simplicity and the availability of powerful libraries for data manipulation and interface development. By the end of the project, we had successfully created a simulation tool that met the requirements and provided meaningful insights into the real-world application of Huffman coding in language-based data compression.
